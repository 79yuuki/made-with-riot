## Adding a project to Made With Riot

(WIP)

## Working locally

To run the project, follow the steps bellow after cloning the repository:

```bash
npm install
gulp compile:all
gulp lift
```

Then access the application on http://localhost:8000/

### Development

For developing, simply run the command `gulp watch:all` for automatic re-compiling on file changes.

The project is using Sass as CSS pre-processor and actually all tags styles are in separated files.
